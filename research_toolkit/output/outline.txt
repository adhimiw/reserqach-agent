         - Reduces friction and prevents cartilage degradation
      
      c. Organ and tissue protection
         - Protects spinal cord and sensitive tissues
         - Maintains cellular structure and function
      
      d. Waste elimination
         - Facilitates urinary output
         - Supports bowel movement and perspiration
         - Removes metabolic byproducts

   2. Nutrient transport at cellular level
      a. Brings nutrients to cells
      b. Facilitates absorption and distribution
