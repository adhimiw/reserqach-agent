NOTE FOR FINAL DOCUMENT PREPARATION
================================================================================

When integrating into your academic paper:

1. Place this bibliography at the end of the paper, starting on a new page
2. Title it: "References" (not "Bibliography" in APA format)
3. Use a hanging indent for each reference (first line flush left, 
   subsequent lines indented 0.5 inches)
4. Maintain single spacing within references, double spacing between them
5. Use only the sources you actually cite in your paper
6. Format the final document in your word processor (Google Docs, Word, etc.)
   to ensure proper APA formatting with hanging indents
